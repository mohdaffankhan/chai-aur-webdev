### Lexical Scoping
Lexical scope in JavaScript is a convention that determines how variables are accessible in a block of code. It's also known as static scoping. 

### Closures
In JavaScript, a closure is a function that has access to the variables of the outer functions (parent's scope), even after the outer functions have finished executing.
